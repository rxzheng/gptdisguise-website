This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our product or services.

Information We Collect
We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide access to paid features. This consists of an email address or login credentials used solely for account identification and payment verification.

We do not collect, store, or process any other personal information. We do not collect usage data, analytics, device information, location data, or content entered while using the product.

How We Use Information

Communicating essential service-related information

We do not use this information for marketing, tracking, profiling, or advertising.

Data Storage and Security
Login and payment-related information is handled securely and is accessed only as required to provide the service. Where third-party payment processors are used, they are responsible for securely handling payment information under their own privacy policies.

We do not store full payment card details on our servers.

Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties, except where required to process payments or comply with legal obligations.
